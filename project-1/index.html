            <h2>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah:</h2>
            <h2>Our National Hero:</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Quaid-e-Azam means “Great Leader” </b>in Urdu, and it refers to
              Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the man who played a crucial role in creating
              Pakistan. He was born on December 25, 1876. Jinnah was a smart
              lawyer and a strong leader. He led the All-India Muslim League and
              asked for a separate country for Muslims. <br />
              Because of his hard work and leadership, Pakistan came into
              existence on August 14, 1947, as a new independent country. Jinnah
              believed in unity, faith, and discipline, and these became the
              important principles for the new nation. <br />
              After Pakistan was formed, Jinnah became its first leader. He
              wanted everyone in the country to have equal rights, no matter
              their religion. Jinnah focused on education, fairness, and
              building a strong nation. <br />
              Even though Jinnah passed away in 1948, people still remember him
              as Quaid-e-Azam with great respect. His ideas and principles
              continue to inspire Pakistanis, teaching them the values of
              tolerance, hard work, and coming together for a better future.
              Quaid-e-Azam’s legacy is a reminder of the important principles
              that shape Pakistan’s identity.
